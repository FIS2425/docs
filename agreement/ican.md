# iCan analysis

We analyzed the customer agreement with [ican](https://elenamolino.github.io/unfair-terms-detector-app/) to find and fix abusive clauses within our Service.

Out of the flagged terms, we fixed most but the following were considered non-abusive and incorrectly flagged:
- Introduction paragraph: **By signing this agreement with the CloudMedix services (\"Services\"), the Customer agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement.** => We consider this to be a false positive because it does not match with "Contract by using", as we specifically require the Customer to read and sign the document to be considered accepted.
- Item 2.5: **CloudMedix reserves the right to modify its pricing plans and fees at any time, with at least 30 days' notice to the Customer, who may choose to accept the new terms or remain bound to the previous ones.** => We consider this to be a false positive as we are not changing the terms unilaterally. We are instead giving a fair amount of time to consider them, and if the Customer decides to stick with the old terms, they are allowed to.
- Item 3.3: **The Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all claims arising from the Customer's use of the Services, including but not limited to any misuse of the Services or violation of applicable laws, of which CloudMedix shall not be liable for any such claims.** => We are liable for any claim the Customer or Users may arise, except for when they break the terms of service of applicable laws, where we consider the validity of the claim is overruled.
- Item 9.2: **Disputes may be resolved via any legal means available in the Customer's juristiction, although CloudMedix shall facilitate the resolution of disputes amicably, and if necessary, through arbitration.** => We are not forcing arbitration here, what we are is facilitating the resolution via this means, but leaving the door open to the Customer to file a lawsuit if legal claim through any other means if they consider it to be more fit.
